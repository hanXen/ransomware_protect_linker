    Moves a file from the source path to the destination path.

            - If the file is in use by another process, it advises closing the file.
        - Handles `OSError`:
            - Attempts to use `shutil.move` as a fallback if `os.rename` fails.

        - Ensure the source file exists and the destination path is valid.
